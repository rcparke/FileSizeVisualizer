A tool for visualizing storage usage.

Inspired by WizTree, a highly optimized visualizer, and duviz, a python command line visualizer.


Going to use Python to get more comfortable, I want to work with Python ML libraries in future projects.
For the visualization, ideally I will end up using a treemap, but I will use horizontal bar graphs initially.

Look into https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html, specifically os.stat and ost.stat_result as well as https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html, specifically os.path.split().
