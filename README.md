A tool for visualizing storage usage.

I recommend using WizTree, which this project is inspired by, as this is a highly unoptimized tool made recreationally


Going to use Python to get more comfortable, I want to work with Python ML libraries in future projects.
For the visualization, ideally I will end up using a treemap, but I will use horizontal bar graphs initially.
